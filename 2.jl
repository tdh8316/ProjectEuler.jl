# Even Fibonacci numbers

#=
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

a = 1
b = 0
total = 0

while a + b < 4_000_000
	global a, b, total
	
	if (a + b) % 2 == 0
		total += a + b
	end
	a, b = b, a + b
end

println(total)
